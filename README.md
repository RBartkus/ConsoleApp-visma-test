Visma test for summer internship 2021

I did the task. The task turned out to be quite clear and simple. I didnt have much trouble.

With more time the program could be further optimized and simplified. And some "bugs" get fixed.

All in all, it was a great experience. I look forward to your reply and feedback.

ONE MAJOR BUG!!!
File(Books.json) relative path not working!
If you want to use the program properly, please manually change path to file location on your machine.
DataContext.cs line 82 and line 95
